# EvolveTrade: Algorithmic Trading Engine in Rust

EvolveTrade is a high-performance, customizable algorithmic trading engine built in Rust, designed for rapid iteration and robust execution of automated trading strategies. It provides a solid foundation for building sophisticated trading systems, leveraging Rust's speed, memory safety, and concurrency capabilities to ensure reliable and efficient performance in demanding market environments. This project aims to empower both individual traders and institutional developers to create and deploy cutting-edge trading algorithms with confidence.

The core objective of EvolveTrade is to abstract away the complexities of interacting with market data feeds, order execution APIs, and risk management systems, allowing developers to focus solely on the logic of their trading strategies. It offers a modular architecture, allowing users to easily integrate different data sources, brokers, and analytical tools. Furthermore, it emphasizes backtesting and simulation capabilities, enabling thorough evaluation and optimization of trading strategies before deployment in live markets. EvolveTrade is built with extensibility in mind, facilitating the addition of custom indicators, order types, and risk management rules, ensuring adaptability to evolving market conditions and individual trading styles.

EvolveTrade goes beyond simply providing a framework; it offers a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and libraries to support the entire trading lifecycle. From data ingestion and preprocessing to signal generation and order execution, each component is meticulously designed for performance and reliability. The project incorporates robust error handling and monitoring mechanisms to proactively identify and address potential issues, minimizing the risk of unexpected failures. By combining Rust's inherent strengths with a thoughtfully designed architecture, EvolveTrade provides a distinct advantage for developers seeking to build sophisticated and resilient algorithmic trading systems.

## Key Features

*   **High-Performance Event Handling:** Uses Tokio's asynchronous runtime to efficiently handle large volumes of market data events. This allows the engine to process incoming data with minimal latency and ensures timely execution of trading signals. The architecture is built around channels for efficient inter-component communication.

*   **Modular Data Feed Integration:** Supports integration with multiple data feeds (e.g., Alpaca, IEX, Binance) through a common interface. New data feed connectors can be easily added by implementing the `MarketDataFeed` trait. The data feeds are responsible for handling authentication, data parsing, and error handling specific to the provider.

*   **Customizable Strategy Framework:** Provides a flexible framework for defining and executing trading strategies. Strategies are implemented as separate modules that consume market data and generate trading signals. The strategy framework handles signal filtering, position sizing, and order management.

*   **Comprehensive Backtesting Engine:** Includes a backtesting engine that allows users to evaluate trading strategies on historical data. The backtesting engine simulates market conditions and provides detailed performance metrics, such as profit and loss, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. The backtester supports event-driven simulation and can handle tick-by-tick data.

*   **Risk Management Module:** Incorporates a risk management module that allows users to define and enforce risk limits. The risk management module can monitor portfolio exposure, track trading activity, and automatically adjust positions to mitigate risk. Customizable rules can be implemented based on value-at-risk (VaR) or other metrics.

*   **Order Execution Interface:** Provides a standardized interface for submitting and managing orders through multiple brokers. Broker connectors handle order routing, execution, and reporting. Supports various order types, including market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders.

*   **Real-time Monitoring and Logging:** Includes comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities that provide real-time insights into the performance of the trading engine. Metrics are exposed through a Prometheus endpoint for easy integration with monitoring tools. Logs are structured for easy analysis and debugging.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The core programming language providing performance, safety, and concurrency.
*   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for building concurrent and scalable applications. Used for handling I/O and scheduling tasks.
*   **Serde:** A serialization and deserialization framework for efficient data handling. Used for parsing market data and configuration files.
*   **Reqwest:** An asynchronous HTTP client used for interacting with data feeds and broker APIs.
*   **Chronotope:** A date and time library for handling timestamps and time intervals.
*   **Log:** A logging facade for providing a consistent logging interface.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  Clone the EvolveTrade repository:
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/EvolveTrade.git
3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd EvolveTrade
4.  Build the project:
    cargo build --release
5.  The compiled binary will be located in the `target/release` directory.

## Configuration

EvolveTrade uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and define the following variables:

*   `DATA_FEED_API_KEY`: API key for your chosen data feed provider.
*   `BROKER_API_KEY`: API key for your chosen broker.
*   `BROKER_API_SECRET`: API secret for your chosen broker.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: URL for the database to store historical data and trade executions.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., "info", "debug", "error").

Example `.env` file:

DATA_FEED_API_KEY=YOUR_DATA_FEED_API_KEY
BROKER_API_KEY=YOUR_BROKER_API_KEY
BROKER_API_SECRET=YOUR_BROKER_API_SECRET
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database
LOG_LEVEL=info

## Usage

To run the EvolveTrade engine, execute the compiled binary:

./target/release/evolvetrade

The engine will connect to the configured data feed and broker, and start executing the defined trading strategies.

Example of defining a simple moving average crossover strategy:

(This code would typically be in a separate Rust file within the `src/strategies` directory)

struct MovingAverageCrossover {
    short_period: usize,
    long_period: usize,
}

impl TradingStrategy for MovingAverageCrossover {
    fn on_data(&mut self, data: &MarketData) -> Option<Order> {
        // Calculate short and long moving averages
        let short_ma = calculate_moving_average(&data.prices, self.short_period);
        let long_ma = calculate_moving_average(&data.prices, self.long_period);

        // Generate trading signal
        if short_ma > long_ma {
            Some(Order::new(data.symbol.clone(), OrderType::Buy, 100))
        } else if short_ma < long_ma {
            Some(Order::new(data.symbol.clone(), OrderType::Sell, 100))
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

(Note: This is a simplified example. A complete implementation would require handling errors, managing positions, and implementing more sophisticated risk management.)
