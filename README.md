# EvolveTrade: Decentralized NFT Marketplace with Enhanced Provenance

A cutting-edge decentralized NFT marketplace built with Rust, focusing on on-chain royalties and robust ownership verification using Merkle tree authentication.

EvolveTrade addresses critical challenges in the current NFT landscape: opaque royalty distribution and difficulties in definitively proving the provenance and authenticity of digital assets. Built with Rust for performance, security, and reliability, EvolveTrade provides a transparent and secure platform for NFT trading. It leverages on-chain royalties, ensuring creators are automatically compensated whenever their NFTs are resold. The core of EvolveTrade revolves around the implementation of a Merkle tree-based system for verifying the chain of ownership. Each NFT transaction updates the Merkle tree, generating verifiable proofs that demonstrate the NFT's complete history. This cryptographic approach provides unparalleled transparency and builds trust within the ecosystem.

The platform allows users to mint, list, buy, and sell NFTs with ease. All transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof record of ownership. By leveraging Rust's safety features, EvolveTrade minimizes the risk of common vulnerabilities such as memory leaks and buffer overflows, safeguarding users' digital assets. Furthermore, the marketplace is designed to be highly extensible, allowing developers to easily integrate new features and functionalities. The open-source nature of the project encourages community participation and fosters innovation.

Beyond its core functionality, EvolveTrade is designed with scalability in mind. The Rust implementation allows for efficient resource utilization, enabling the marketplace to handle a large volume of transactions without performance degradation. The modular architecture promotes maintainability and allows for future upgrades with minimal disruption to existing users. EvolveTrade aims to provide a user-friendly and secure environment where creators, collectors, and traders can interact with confidence, knowing that their digital assets are protected by cutting-edge cryptographic technology. This project is a step towards a more equitable and transparent NFT ecosystem, empowered by the capabilities of Rust.

## Key Features

*   **On-Chain Royalties:** Implements automatic royalty distribution to creators directly on the blockchain using smart contracts written in Rust. The royalty percentage is defined at the time of minting and enforced for all subsequent sales.
*   **Merkle Tree Authentication:** Employs a Merkle tree to track the ownership history of each NFT. Each transaction updates the tree, and cryptographic proofs can be generated to verify the complete provenance of an NFT. The root hash of the Merkle tree is stored on-chain for integrity.
*   **Secure Smart Contracts:** The smart contracts governing the marketplace are written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) for execution within a secure runtime environment. Rigorous testing and formal verification methods are employed to ensure contract correctness.
*   **Decentralized Governance (Future Implementation):** A roadmap feature includes decentralized governance mechanisms, enabling token holders to participate in the decision-making process regarding platform upgrades, fee structures, and other key parameters.
*   **Gas Optimization:** The Rust implementation focuses on minimizing gas consumption during transaction execution. Code is optimized for efficiency, and data structures are carefully chosen to reduce storage costs.
*   **NFT Metadata Standards Compliance:** Adheres to established NFT metadata standards, ensuring interoperability with other platforms and wallets. Supports various metadata formats, including JSON and IPFS-hosted data.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A web-based interface provides a seamless and intuitive experience for users to interact with the marketplace. The interface allows users to browse NFTs, place bids, manage their wallets, and view transaction history.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The core programming language used for developing the smart contracts and backend logic due to its performance, security, and reliability.
*   **WebAssembly (Wasm):** The target compilation format for the Rust smart contracts, enabling execution within a secure and portable runtime environment.
*   **Blockchain:** The underlying distributed ledger technology used for recording NFT ownership and transaction history. The specific blockchain used will depend on the deployment environment (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, etc.).
*   **Merkle Tree Implementation:** A custom implementation of the Merkle tree algorithm for verifying NFT provenance. The implementation is optimized for performance and security.
*   **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Used for storing NFT metadata and media files in a decentralized and censorship-resistant manner.
*   **Web Framework (e.g., Actix-web or Rocket):** Used for building the backend API and serving the web interface.
*   **Frontend Framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, or Svelte):** Used for developing the user interface for interacting with the marketplace.

## Installation

1.  **Install Rust:** Download and install the Rust toolchain from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/EvolveTrade.git
    cd EvolveTrade
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the `smart_contracts` directory and run:
    cargo build --release
4. **Install Frontend Dependencies:** Navigate to the 'frontend' directory and run:
   npm install

## Configuration

The following environment variables need to be configured:

*   `BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK`: The blockchain network to connect to (e.g., `mainnet`, `testnet`, `localhost`).
*   `SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the deployed smart contract.
*   `IPFS_GATEWAY`: The URL of the IPFS gateway to use for retrieving NFT metadata.
*   `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the wallet to use for signing transactions.
*   `API_PORT`: The port on which the API server will listen (e.g., `8080`).

These can be set using a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

## Usage

**Smart Contract API:**

The smart contract API provides functions for minting NFTs, listing NFTs for sale, buying NFTs, and transferring ownership. These functions can be accessed through a Web3 library (e.g., `web3.js` or `ethers.js`) in the frontend.

Example (using ethers.js):

<pre>
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK);
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(process.env.SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, EvolveTradeABI, wallet);

async function mintNFT(tokenURI) {
  const tx = await contract.mintNFT(tokenURI);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("NFT Minted!");
}
</pre>

**Frontend API:**

The frontend provides a web interface for interacting with the marketplace. Users can browse NFTs, place bids, manage their wallets, and view transaction history. The API endpoints for the backend are documented separately (refer to API documentation for details).
